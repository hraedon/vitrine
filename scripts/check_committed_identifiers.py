"""Mechanical gate against committing work-domain identifiers.

Two complementary checks:

1. Always-on (no configuration): no tracked file may live under ``samples/``.
   ``.gitignore`` is advisory — ``git add -f`` bypasses it — so this guard makes
   an accidental force-add of a real identifier-bearing data file fail CI. The
   ``samples/`` directory holds real environment data (hostnames, service
   accounts, principal handles) that must never be committed (AGENTS.md).

2. Secret-driven: when ``VITRINE_FORBIDDEN_IDENTIFIERS`` is set (a
   whitespace-separated list of real identifiers — hostnames, emails, service
   accounts, principal handles, personal names), every tracked text file
   outside ``samples/`` is scanned for those identifiers. This catches real
   names that leaked into docs, tests, or reflections. It is a no-op (exit 0)
   until the secret is configured, so it never blocks a fresh clone or a fork
   without the secret.
