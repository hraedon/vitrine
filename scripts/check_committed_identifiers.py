"""Mechanical gate against committing work-domain identifiers.

Two complementary checks:

1. Always-on (no configuration): no tracked file may live under ``samples/``.
   ``.gitignore`` is advisory — ``git add -f`` bypasses it — so this guard makes
   an accidental force-add of a real identifier-bearing data file fail CI. The
   ``samples/`` directory holds real environment data (hostnames, service
   accounts, principal handles) that must never be committed (AGENTS.md).

2. Secret-driven: when ``VITRINE_FORBIDDEN_IDENTIFIERS`` is set (a
   whitespace-separated list of real identifiers — hostnames, emails, service
   accounts, principal handles, personal names), every tracked text file
   outside ``samples/`` is scanned for those identifiers. This catches real
   names that leaked into docs, tests, or reflections.

   Unconfigured behaviour depends on ``publication.toml``. In a repo declaring
   ``private-until-review`` (or with no declaration at all) a missing secret is a
   no-op (exit 0), so a fresh clone or a fork without the secret is never
   blocked. In a repo declaring ``visibility = "public"`` it is a **failure**
   (exit 1): an unconfigured gate there prints "skipping" and exits 0, which is
   indistinguishable from a clean tree — a silent pass on exactly the repos where
   a leak is irreversible. That asymmetry was documented in publication.toml for
   months before it was implemented here.

   In ``--staged`` mode (the pre-commit hook) the scan reads the **staged index
   blobs** (``git show :0:<path>``), never the working tree: the commit records
   the index, and worktree bytes can legitimately differ from it (``git add
   -p``, staging then editing). Scanning the worktree let a staged forbidden
   identifier hide behind a clean unstaged copy — and blocked clean commits
   whose worktree copy was dirty (WI-031).

   **Multi-word identifiers are double-quoted** (``"two words"``) and match any
   separator run — spaced, hyphenated, underscored, dotted, or wrapped across a
   line break. Before this, the parser split unconditionally on whitespace, so a
   multi-word identifier could not be expressed at all: its halves became short
   tokens that the length filter dropped. A real two-word work-domain name sat
   undetected in sixteen repositories — eight of them public — because of that
   blind spot. Any denylist entry containing a space must stay quoted.

    distinction is the whole point: a private-until-review repo must stay
    clonable and committable without the secret, but a PUBLIC repo whose gate is
    unconfigured is a silent pass — the scan prints "skipping" and exits 0, and
    nothing downstream can tell that apart from a clean tree.

    Absence of the file is False (fail-open): a repo that never opted into the
    publication system is not suddenly blocked. A file that is PRESENT but
    unparseable is a GateError, not False — that repo did opt in, and guessing
    its visibility is exactly the coin-flip this function exists to remove.
