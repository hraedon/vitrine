"""Mechanical gate against committing work-domain identifiers.

Two complementary checks:

1. Always-on (no configuration): no tracked file may live under ``samples/``.
   ``.gitignore`` is advisory — ``git add -f`` bypasses it — so this guard makes
   an accidental force-add of a real identifier-bearing data file fail CI. The
   ``samples/`` directory holds real environment data (hostnames, service
   accounts, principal handles) that must never be committed (AGENTS.md).

2. Secret-driven: when ``VITRINE_FORBIDDEN_IDENTIFIERS`` is set (a
   whitespace-separated list of real identifiers — hostnames, emails, service
   accounts, principal handles, personal names), every tracked text file
   outside ``samples/`` is scanned for those identifiers. This catches real
   names that leaked into docs, tests, or reflections.

   Unconfigured behaviour depends on ``publication.toml``. In a repo declaring
   ``private-until-review`` (or with no declaration at all) a missing secret is a
   no-op (exit 0), so a fresh clone or a fork without the secret is never
   blocked. In a repo declaring ``visibility = "public"`` it is a **failure**
   (exit 1): an unconfigured gate there prints "skipping" and exits 0, which is
   indistinguishable from a clean tree — a silent pass on exactly the repos where
   a leak is irreversible. That asymmetry was documented in publication.toml for
   months before it was implemented here.

   In ``--staged`` mode (the pre-commit hook) the scan reads the **staged index
   blobs** (``git show :0:<path>``), never the working tree: the commit records
   the index, and worktree bytes can legitimately differ from it (``git add
   -p``, staging then editing). Scanning the worktree let a staged forbidden
   identifier hide behind a clean unstaged copy — and blocked clean commits
   whose worktree copy was dirty (WI-031).

   **Multi-word identifiers are double-quoted** (``"two words"``) and match any
   separator run — spaced, hyphenated, underscored, dotted, or wrapped across a
   line break. Before this, the parser split unconditionally on whitespace, so a
   multi-word identifier could not be expressed at all: its halves became short
   tokens that the length filter dropped. A real two-word work-domain name sat
   undetected in sixteen repositories — eight of them public — because of that
   blind spot. Any denylist entry containing a space must stay quoted.

    only if it cleanly says "private-until-review"; a commit WITHOUT one is safe
    only if every parent is safe (a root commit without one is safe -- never opted
    in). The state being judged (the index or worktree with no declaration) has
    HEAD as its parent, so absence is a skip exactly when HEAD is safe -- and,
    since an orphan branch or a fresh root cut from a public repo is still that
    public repo, only when every tip of the graph of HEAD and all refs (local,
    remote-tracking, tags; not refs/stash, a local snapshot) is safe too. A tip
    is a commit no other walked commit descends from: a ref at an ANCESTOR of a
    clean private declaration is superseded by it, which is what lets a repo
    with old public-era tags leave the publication system.

    Limit, stated plainly: a lineage whose every ref was deleted locally is not

    repo that never had them), and counting dangling commits would refuse
    ordinary rebased-away and dropped-stash history. CI judges a fresh full
    clone, which carries the remote's refs. This covers plain
    and merge deletions, laundering through an invalid declaration, a merge that
    joins an unsafe absent lineage to a private one, and orphan branches. To leave
    the publication system, declare "private-until-review" and remove the file in
